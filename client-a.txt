A project to have a player guess a number between 1 and ten. the computer generates a random number each play. the player has three tries.

Let's start with printing, "Hello, would you like to play a game? Yes or no?" there is also an imput box
the response yes will launch a random number generator generating an integer between 1 and ten.
it will also launch a dialog box that prints "1st try" and contains an input box
if the players response is true to the randomly generated integer, cgi fireworks erupt on screen; if false a new dialog box opens print enclosed "two tries left" 
if the players response is true to the randomly generated integer, cgi fireworks erupt on screen; if false a new dialog box opens print enclosed "last try" 
if the players response is true to the randomly generated integer, cgi fireworks erupt on screen; if false a new dialog box opens print enclosed "thank you for trying, please try again with a brand new number to guess!"
